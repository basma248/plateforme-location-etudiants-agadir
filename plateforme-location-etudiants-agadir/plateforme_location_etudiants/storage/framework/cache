The directory `/plateforme_location_etudiants/plateforme_location_etudiants/storage/framework/cache` is typically used by Laravel to store cached data. This directory is usually managed by the framework itself and does not contain any specific files that need to be manually created or populated. Therefore, this directory is intentionally left blank.
